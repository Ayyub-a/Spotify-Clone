# Spotify-Clone
This is a simple clone of Spotify built using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout and basic design of the popular music streaming platform, providing a visually similar interface. The project demonstrates my skills in creating responsive web designs and static layouts without the use of JavaScript or any backend functionality.

Responsive design for both desktop and mobile views.
Header and navigation bar similar to Spotify.
Styled music player interface with a modern look.
Custom font and icons that resemble Spotifyâ€™s UI.
